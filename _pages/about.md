I am a PhD student in the joint program of the Materials Science and Engineering department (DMSE) and the Center for Computational Science (CSE) at [MIT](https://dmse.mit.edu/) advised by Prof. [Rafael Gomez-Bombarelli](https://dmse.mit.edu/faculty/rafael-gomez-bombarelli/).

I am passionate about developing practical ML tools for materials inverse design, focusing on both predictive
and generative strategies. 

Research questions I am currently drawn to involve crystal structure prediction from spectroscopic techniques, and developing representation learning methods that incorporate structure to improve out-of-distribution generalization for materials.

I received my B.Sc. in Materials Science and Engineering at the [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/), supported by the [Technnion Rothschild Excellence Fellowship](https://excellence.technion.ac.il/en/).
