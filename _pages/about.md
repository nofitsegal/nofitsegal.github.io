I am a PhD student in the joint program of the Materials Science and Engineering department (DMSE) and Center for Computational Science (CSE) at [MIT](https://dmse.mit.edu/) advised by Prof. [Rafael Gomez-Bombarelli](https://dmse.mit.edu/faculty/rafael-gomez-bombarelli/).

I am passionate about developing practical ML tools for materials inverse design, focusing on both predictive
and generative strategies. 

Research questions I am currently drawn to involve Learning representations and incorporate structure in learning algorithms that facilitate out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization for materials.

I received my B.Sc. in Materials Science and Engineering at the Technion, supported by the Technnion Rothschild Excellence Fellowship.
