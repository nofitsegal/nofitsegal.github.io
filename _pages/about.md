<h1 class="visually-hidden">Nofit Segal</h1>

I am a PhD student in the joint program in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering (DMSE) and the Center for Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) at [MIT](https://dmse.mit.edu/) advised by Prof. [Rafael Gomez-Bombarelli](https://dmse.mit.edu/people/faculty/rafael-gomez-bombarelli/).

I am passionate about developing practical machine-learning tools for materials inverse design, spanning both predictive and generative approaches. 

My current research focuses on predicting crystal structures from spectroscopic data and designing representation-learning models whose algorithmic structure supports stronger out-of-distribution generalization for materials.

I received my B.Sc. in Materials Science and Engineering from the [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/), supported by the [Technnion Rothschild Excellence Fellowship](https://excellence.technion.ac.il/).
